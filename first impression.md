## About

I am a 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion designer, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd, and gentle soul. I love stories and finding ways to tell them. Plus, I have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, I use it everywhere.


## My projects 

## 3D work

Music visualizers are always fun, because you are trying to put together music and video, two completely separate fields of creativity. But it is so rewarding when you catch the right moment, and suddenly it all works

Sometimes I do some small visualizations of architecture, like this one. Those projects are most of the time very relaxing. You don't have to think creatively. You just go by the blueprint, and that's it. The window for error is very very small.

## 2D work
When I am a little tired of 3D, I take a vacation in motion graphics. There are things just one dimension less complicated.


This was my work for the city of Hostivice, where I was doing the animation of their logo. There, I was trying to tell the story of people who come together and generate ideas to make their city better, which was the main goal of the project. This project was pretty significant for me because it was my first logo animation work.

## Hobby
