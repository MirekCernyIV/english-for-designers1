## About



<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->
I am 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion deigner, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd and genle soul. I love stories and finding ways to tell them. Plus i have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, i use it everywhere.
