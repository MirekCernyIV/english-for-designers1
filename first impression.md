## About

I am 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion deigner, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd and genle soul. I love stories and finding ways to tell them. Plus i have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, i use it everywhere. 

Sometimes I am amazed


## My projects 

## 3D work

Music visualizer are alwayes fun, beacuse you are tring to put togheter music and video. Two complatly separate fields of creativity, but they are so rewarding, when you catch the right momnent and suddenly it all works. 

Some times i do some small visualisations of architercture, like this one. Those project are most of the time very relaxing. You dont have to think creativly. You just go by the blueprint and thats it. 

## 2D work
When i am little tired of 3D, I take vacation in motion graphics. THere are things just one dimesnsion less complicated. 


This was my work for city, hostivice, where i was doing animation of their logo. This project was pretty signicficant for me, because it was my first logo animation work. 

## Hobby
