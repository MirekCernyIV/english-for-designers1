## Litlle about my human being

I am a 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion designer, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd, and gentle soul.
- So in another words you can say. i convert texts and paragraphs into pictures and it just depends on you how many of them fo you want and how fast they will go.
- I love stories and finding ways to tell them.
Plus, I have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, I use it everywhere.


## My projects 

## 3D work

Music visualizers are always fun, because you are trying to put together music and video, two completely separate fields of creativity. But it is so rewarding when you catch the right moment, and suddenly it all works

Sometimes I do some small visualizations of architecture, like this one. Despite the fact that almost everything is on the blueprint, you still need to use a little bit of creativity for the interior. So, for a brief moment, I become an interior designer. Who knows, which type of wood is best for the floor, which for the ceiling, and all kinds of this stuff.


## 2D work
When I am a little tired of 3D, I take a vacation in motion graphics. There are things just one dimension less complicated.

This was my work for the city of Hostivice, where I was doing the animation of their logo. There, I was trying to tell the story of people. That come together and generate ideas to make their city better, which was the main goal of the project. This work was pretty significant for me because it was my first logo animation work.

## What i do in the shadows (Hope you cought the referenc)

### Illustrations

- When i have some time on my hands i use it to draw. I love mythology and history, so i am traing combine these topics togheter with more modern styles. Like the hypster Odin, circle of life,
-Sometimes i just want draw, what come to my mind like Brain jazz or Happy a trash.
### Student film

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->


 - My biggest curent project is stident film, where i am working on script, storyboards, animatics, concept art, 3D modeling, rigging, dabing, animation and compositing........so sometimes it can be little bit overwhelming.
- Despite eache of these categories brings completly new and different problem. The biggest chllange for me is to forget ideas. It is very common, that suddenly, i come with new way to tell the story and out of blue i catch myself changing the whole script.
- This project is pretty significant for me, beacuse i have chance to try different fields. And find, that interests me mmost.
