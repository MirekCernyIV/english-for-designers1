### TVOJE Hostivice

- This was my work for the city of Hostivice, where I was doing the animation of their logo. There, I was trying to tell the story of people, who come with ideas to make their city better. That was the main goal of the project.
- This work was pretty significant for me because it was my first logo animation work.

## 3D motion graphics

-  On this project i was working, when i was on internship in PFX. I made evrything here, from animation, 3D modeling, riging and texturing.
-  I am fascinated with music. So whenever there is a chance to work on something remotely close to this topic, I take it without hesitation.

- Sometimes I do some small visualizations of architecture, like this one. Despite the fact that almost everything is on the blueprint, you still need to use a little bit of creativity for the interior.
- So, for a brief moment, I become an interior designer. Who knows, which type of wood is best for the floor, which for the ceiling, and all kinds of this stuff.


  


### Illustrations

- When I have some time on my hands, I use it to draw. I love mythology and history, so I am trying to combine these topics together with more modern styles, like the hipster Odin or Circle of life (where the 3 lizards reprezent three differnet religions) 
- These things are just something, that i do to relax my little smooth brain. 




- ## 3D Visualizer

- Music visualizers are always fun, because you are trying to put together music and video, two completely separate fields of creativity. But it is so rewarding when you catch the right moment, and suddenly it all works
