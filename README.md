## Voice

1. Funny: Most of the time, I try to make people around me laugh and feel happy. So, making jokes is one of the most important parts of my voice. It helps to make some serious situations less stressful. It also helps to make new friends and contacts. It can even spark new creative ideas when I am making fun of something. That's why I use it very often, and it is my main way of presenting my voice.

2. Honest: I always tell the truth, and when the truth isn't very pleasing to hear, I'd rather stay silent or find a way around it.

3. Adaptable: I always try to adapt to the new situations in which I find myself, including how other people communicate and what the best way to talk to them is.
