1. Funny: Most of times i try to make people around me laugh and feel happy. So making jokes is one of the most importatn part of my voice. It helps to make some sirus situations less stresfull. It also helps to make new frends and contacs. It also san sparks some new creative ideas, when i am makeing fun of someting. Thats why i use it very often and it is my main way of, how i present my voic. 
2. Honest - I am always telling the truth and when the truth istn very pleasing to hear. I rather stay silent or find the way around it. 
3. Adaptable - I always try to adapt to the new situation in which i am. How other people comunicate and what is the best way to talk to them.
