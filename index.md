## Little about my human being

I am a 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion designer, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd, and gentle soul.
- So in another words you can say. i convert texts and paragraphs into pictures and it just depends on you how many of them fo you want and how fast they will go.
- I love stories and finding ways to tell them.
- Like any other introvert, I prefer to work alone, but I also love working in a team. I am sometimes amazed at how many ideas a small group can come up with.
- Plus, I have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, I use it everywhere.


## My projects 

## 3D work
### VIsualizer

- Sometimes I do some small visualizations of architecture, like this one. Despite the fact that almost everything is on the blueprint, you still need to use a little bit of creativity for the interior.
- So, for a brief moment, I become an interior designer. Who knows, which type of wood is best for the floor, which for the ceiling, and all kinds of this stuff.


## 2D work
- When I am a little tired of 3D, I take a vacation in motion graphics. There are things just one dimension less complicated.
### TVOJE Hostivice

- This was my work for the city of Hostivice, where I was doing the animation of their logo. There, I was trying to tell the story of people, who come with ideas to make their city better. That was the main goal of the project.
- This work was pretty significant for me because it was my first logo animation work.

## What i do in the shadows/ My free time

Music visualizers are always fun, because you are trying to put together music and video, two completely separate fields of creativity. But it is so rewarding when you catch the right moment, and suddenly it all works


### Illustrations

- When I have some time on my hands, I use it to draw. I love mythology and history, so I am trying to combine these topics together with more modern styles, like the hipster Odin or Circle of life (where the 3 lizards reprezent three differnet religions) 
- These things are just something, that i do to relax my little smooth brain. 
### Student film

![the future is maniac](https://github.com/MirekCernyIV/english-for-designers1/assets/149397901/a3c1d36a-88dd-46f6-a7a1-3218ece7a84b)




- My greatest current project is a student film where I am working on the script, storyboards, animatics, concept art, 3D modeling, rigging, dubbing, animation, and compositing.  So sometimes, it can be a little bit overwhelming.

- Despite each of these categories bringing completely new and different problems, the biggest challenge for me is to forget ideas. It is very common that suddenly, I come up with a new way to tell the story, and out of the blue, I catch myself changing the whole script.

- This project is pretty significant for me because I have the chance to try different fields and learn new skills.
