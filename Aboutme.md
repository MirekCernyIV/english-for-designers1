# I am 
## 3D artist and motion designer (+ video editing and illustration)
- I was alwayes gamer and it is still one of the things, that i sometimes forget, becuse it so very common thing for me.And i think this is the thing, which got me in to the this carrer. I like to play with things and traing to find the solutions for problems in fron to me. It doesnt really matter, what kind of project i am working on (video, graphics, aniamtion, illustration). My approge is still the same like to any other video game. THere is a this problem. Those are the tools and rules. Win the game with best score, that you can have. The boss destroyed you and your project? It doesnt matter, because tomorrow is a day too and you can try again, with more experianc.
- I dont, what kind of game i will play next, but thats the buety of it.
