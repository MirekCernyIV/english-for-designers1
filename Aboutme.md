# I am  3D artist and motion designer (+ video editor and illustration)
I was always a gamer. I have countless hours on my old console, Wii, and I think this is the thing that got me into this career. I like to play with things and try to find solutions for problems in front of me. It doesn't really matter what kind of project I am working on (video, graphics, animation, illustration). My approach is still the same as to any other video game. There is this problem. These are the tools and rules. Win the game with the best score in a limited time. Is the boss hard? Did he destroy you and your project? It doesn't matter because tomorrow is a day too, and you can try again with more experience. I don't know what kind of game I will play next. What will be the rules? What kind of technique will I use or piece of inspiration? But that's the beauty of it.
