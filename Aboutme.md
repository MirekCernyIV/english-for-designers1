#About me
- I am a 3D generalist, VFX/video editor, motion designer, illustrator, basic graphic designer, nerd, and gentle soul.

So in another words you can say. i convert texts and paragraphs into pictures and it just depends on you how many of them fo you want and how fast they will go.
I love stories and finding ways to tell them.
Like any other introvert, I prefer to work alone, but I also love working in a team. I am sometimes amazed at how many ideas a small group can come up with.
Plus, I have only one good photo of myself. So naturally, I use it everywhere.
