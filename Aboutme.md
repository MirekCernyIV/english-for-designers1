## 3D artist and motion designer (+ video editing and illustration)
- I was alwayes gamer. I have countless houres on my old concsole Wii And i think this is the thing, which got me in to the this carrer. I like to play with things and traying to find the solutions for problems in fron to me. It doesnt really matter, what kind of project i am working on (video, graphics, aniamtion, illustration). My approge is still the same like to any other video game. THere is a this problem. Those are the tools and rules. Win the game with best score in limited time. Is the boss hard? Did he destroy you and your project? It doesnt matter, because tomorrow is a day too and you can try again, with more experianc. I dont, what kind of game i will play next. What will be the rules. What kind of technique i use or piece of inspiration, but thats the buety of it.
