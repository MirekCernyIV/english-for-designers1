# I am  3D artist and motion designer (+ video editor and illustration)
Honestly, this section is very hard for me because, unlike others, I didn't really know what I wanted to do (and in some ways, I still do not know). I wasn't some genius kid who, from a young age, knew that being a spaceman was his destiny. I knew that I could decently draw, but am I good enough? Is this the aim of my life that I should pursue? Will anybody pay me for it? Those were the questions that haunted me for nine years of my life. After those years, I said, "Forget it. Let's give it a try." And after the next five years, here I am, doing what I love, and somehow people pay me for it. It was a wild journey (and it still is). I've tried game concept art, illustrations, 2D/3D animations, VFX, 3D modeling, graphic design, motion design, illustration, and video editing. So now I find myself caught in the middle, where I can do all these things, always learning something new.
