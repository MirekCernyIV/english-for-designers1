<h1>Who came with the world but</h1>
I absolutely despise the word "but," and I believe I am not alone in my strong dislike for this word. This tiny winy innocent word wields a surprising amount of power, allowing anyone to leverage it to their advantage.
My feelings toward this word can best be described as a love-hate relationship. I hate the word and what it can do, but I still find myself using it when I need to
To get why I dislike this word so much, you've got to understand the kind of power it holds. Even though it's a tiny word, it can first make, that others agree with your idea, then tear it apart and throw it in trash. 
It's like a diplomatic tool that lets you be all sweet and understanding in the first part of a sentence, making it seem like you're on the same page as the person you're talking to. But then, when you drop the word "but," it's like pulling the trigger on your fictional gun and killing other persons idea.
Even though I hate this word, and it makes me on the edge  whenever I hear it, I can't deny that I use it often. I get why it's necessary to make a good argument.
